    <h2>Problem:</h2>
    <p> Given a regulated industry with strict privacy requirements, an environment of increasing threats, high
        incident costs, and growing consumer demand for digital services. Distributed development and
        responsibilities risked privacy quality and weakend consumer protection. </p>
    <h2>Solution:</h2> <img src="privacy-first.png" alt="Privacy First">
    <p>Updated Privacy Policy to improve transparency, position privacy as a feature, and provide clear
        guidelines for marketers and developers.</p>
    <p>Hardened sites and content in 2016, adding HTTPS everywhere and cross-domain limits to our web content
        technology governance.</p>
    <p>Advocated for stronger governance and pushed adoption of FTC’s “.COM Disclosure Guidelines’. Formed
        alliances with Legal, Compliance, and Security teams. Educated on privacy trends and threats in online
        behavioral advertising and social media integration.</p>
    <h2>Result:</h2>
    <p>Making privacy a site feature led to early identification of weaknesses in partner solutions. Sites
        passed periodic Security, Government, and Customer audits. And, advocacy strengthened collaboration with
        Legal, Compliance, Marketing, and Technology teams and reached senior management.</p>
