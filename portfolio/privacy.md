## Solution:
![Privacy First logo](privacy-first.png "Privacy First")

Updated Privacy Policy to improve transparency, position privacy as a feature, and provide clear guidelines for marketers and developers.

Hardened sites and content in 2016, adding HTTPS everywhere and cross-domain limits to our web content technology governance.

Advocated for stronger governance and pushed adoption of FTC’s “.COM Disclosure Guidelines’. Formed alliances with Legal, Compliance, and Security teams. Educated on privacy trends and threats in online behavioral advertising and social media integration.

## Result:

Making privacy a site feature led to early identification of weaknesses in partner solutions. Sites passed periodic Security, Government, and Customer audits. And, advocacy strengthened collaboration with Legal, Compliance, Marketing, and Technology teams and reached senior management.
