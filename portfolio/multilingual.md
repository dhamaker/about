![Multilingual and legal notices](languages.png "Multilingual Sites")

Implemented bilingual English/Spanish strategy for our U.S. properties using translation platform from MotionPoint.

Followed a local publishing strategy for our Puerto Rico and Mexico properties with centralized services to support Accessibility, SEO, Privacy, and technical expertise.

Created language notification feature in 18 languages to meet letter of law and provide an ‘enhanced’ experience on modern browsers.

## Result:

Bilingual English/Spanish infrastructure is 10 years old and has scaled to support new domains and applications. Mexico and Puerto Rico are able to respond quickly to local needs while saving on infrastructure and consulting expenses. And our ‘enhanced’ language notification solution delighted regulators and was ‘approved’ on the fist pass.
