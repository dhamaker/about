## Summary

Interest in consumer facing web UI where accessibility and privacy are most relevant.

AR and AI (augmented reality) though interesting and needing compliance are not strength.  Leave for younger UXers who can spend a decade or more working out issues.  There _should_ be enough web.

Software (iOS and Android) doable but look consider target web strategy.
