UX design is a privilege and trust. We create online spaces and experiences: the public marketplaces, social clubs, and business settings for the 21st century.

## Public Trust
We have an obligation to the Public. Our work should build trust in products and the Internet. It should satisfy consumer needs, make positive impressions, and be inclusive. It should seem easy and intuitive. Our solutions must be stable, flexible, and inter-operable. And, they need to be accessible by anyone, anywhere, anytime.

## Business Trust

We have an obligation to product owners. Our strategies should produce products that are cost effective and easy to own. Our designs should not add to business risk. They should realize business strategies. And, they should produce long-term assets planned for compatibility with tomorrow’s trends.

## Professional Trust

We have an obligation to our profession. Our activity competes for resources and influence. Our behavior should open UX opportunities. Our practice should create cultures of openness, inquisitiveness, and experimentation. Our advocacy should champion user rights, contribute to standards evolution, and share knowledge with other designers and colleagues.
