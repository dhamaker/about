            <h1>Remembering Mary Barton</h1>
            <p>Art Teacher, Bellville High School</p>
        </header>
        <p>I studied Art with Mary Barton in high school from 1976-1980.</p>
<h2>Teacher</h2>
<p>Mrs. Barton made sure there were art supplies for every student.  There was always different papers, ink, paints, pastels, pencils and whatever material we need for special projects.  I don’t know where she got the funding.  Later, when I had to buy my own supplies, I was realized how lucky we were to have so many different materials to explore and experiment with.</p>
<p>Mrs Barton was constantly learning, exploring, and sharing with her students .  One Summer, she explored air brush.  That year, she brought airbrush supplies to classroom for students to experiment.</p>
<p>She taught us to work in a studio setting, seeking out ideas, holding group critiques, and exploring the individual ways students approached creation.  Focusing on positive and helping students develop their ideas.</p>
<p>She taught us to be constructive and respectful in our critique.</p>
<p>She did not rush or pressure creativity.</p>
<h2>Scholastic Art Awards 1979</h2>

<p>My scholastic art submission was the result of Western theme project of the County Fair.   She’d set up several still-life’s for students to work with: work boots on a chair, overalls hung from a pipe on the wall.  I spent hours painting the overalls.  Kind of obsessive and she let me go on for weeks.</p>  
<p>Mrs. Barton submitted the painting for the Scholastic Awards competition and it took on a life of its own.  She managed the whole thing by mail; this was well before the internet.  One day she told me that I had received a National Award and would be displayed with other winners work.  I did not see the exhibit.  The painting was gone for months and was damaged during return shipping.  Mrs. Barton was mortified and apologetic, a sign of her genuine respect for students and their creativity.</p>

<p>The painting was easily repaired, reframed, and still have it today. I occasional get asked if I want to sell it.  The brush work has a student feel but I can still see the pants on the wall when I look at the painting.  It is a reminder of a great teacher, Mrs. Barton, and classmates who are passed.</p>
