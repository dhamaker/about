> WORKING DRAAT

When you create websites as a profession, eventually someone will ask you this question. The reply matters. It matters to the person asking and it matters to our profession.
Your kids may ask; a chance to empower them as online consumers and creators. Or, someone from Legal or the C-Suite may ask; because they need to make informed business decisions. Or a client may ask; an opportunity to strengthen your relationship around benefits of user experience investment.

The person doesn't care about the technical details or jargon. They need to know its function in human interaction, so they can make informed Legal, Business, Political, and other decisions. And, usually, they don't have weeks to learn.

> HTML is packaging and provides meaning.

## HTML is Packaging

Got something to share with others via the Internet? You'll need to package it. HTML is for packaging for the Web.

* Box is packaging for Amazon order
* Jar is packaging for jam
* Stamped envelope is packaging for letter
* Bottle is packaging for milk
* Wax Paper is packaging for meat

Done well, packaging increases the chances of reaching your audience and growing your customer base. Done poorly, you can frustrate your audience, lose customers, and hurt your bottom line.

Packaging protects products during delivery. It helps them gets to the customer unbroken. Some packaging creates value: communicating the brand, delighting customers, increasing loyalty, minimizing externalities, and helping your bottom line.

### Functions of packaging

* __Safe delivery.__ It makes sure all the parts included in the container, delivered unbroken, and made available as the customer needs them.
* __Protect processors.__ It makes sure that the product handlers can deliver the product quickly, accurately, and affordably without delays or mishaps.
* __Prevent tampering__ Helps customers trust that product is authentic and has not been adulterated. And protects creators from product liability damages.
* __Describe the product.__ Packaging must identify what is inside. Regulations may require creators to disclose ingredients, place of origin, risks, and more to promote consumer welfare.
* __Expedite delivery.__ shipping, distribution, and tracking. Addressing.
* __Communicate brand.__ Apple's packaging is as iconic as their products. It supports a consistent experience across the product life cycle.

Packaging can have broad social and environmental impacts. I can pollute our land, litter our streets, and and kill our seas. Or, it can be reused, composted, and feeds our gardens.<br />
    
## Egg packaging
Perhaps you designed packaging for eggs as a kid. An Egg Drop Project where you designed packaging to protect an egg from a three foot drop. But, to design packaging for a 7.93 billion egg industry is a different game.

Eggs:

* fertile, non-fertile
* Chicken, Ostrich, Goose, Quail, Salmon
* Packaging: material, size
* carton, filler, crate
* 12, 36, 180
* Styrofoam, Cardboard, plastic

## HTML provides Meaning

Words can change the world. But, without structure (titles, paragraphs, sections, layout, pauses, emphasis) words are not very useful. Imagine the <cite>Declaration of Independence</cite>, <cite>Mother Goose</cite>, or a Sunday sermon spoken in even monotone, or one long line of text written on the highway between Los Angeles and Atlanta.
    
We need structure to share our ideas with others.

* Structure to provide meaning for people and to machines
* Presentation create impact and pleasant to receive
* Behavior to enable interaction
* Protection from forgery

### An International Standard

HTML is a standard way for packaging content so it can be moved around and used by various agents on theInternet.
HTML packaging helps<br /> * Google rank your pages and render them in search results.

* Social media post your messages and embed your videos on your customer's streams.
* Web browsers present a document to your customer as you intend it.
* Siri read your document out loud, with proper structure so your customer can follow your story.
* Customer share your content with others.
* Your websites and applications have a consistent experience.
        
HTML structures your content so is meaningful, allowing you to indicated titles, paragraphs, headings, lists, asides, sections, chapters, tables, and more.

The Web without structure. Click the "Demo" button to see what this page would look like without HTML.

<script src="/js/functions.js"></script> 
<button onclick="setNullStyle(this)">HTML Structure Demo</button>

HTML is instructions that let you include images, video, sound, behavior, and other functions to support your message.
