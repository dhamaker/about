    </header>
    <h1>HTML: WORKING DRAFT</h1>
    <p>When you create websites as a profession, eventually someone will ask you this question. The reply
        matters. It matters to the person asking and it matters to our profession.</p>
    <p>Your kids may ask; a chance to empower them as online consumers and creators. Or, someone from Legal or
        the C-Suite may ask; because they need to make informed business decisions. Or a client may ask; an
        opportunity to strengthen your relationship around benefits of user experience investment.</p>
    <p>The person doesn't care about the technical details or jargon. They need to know its function in human
        interaction, so they can make informed Legal, Business, Political, and other decisions. And, usually,
        they don't have weeks to learn.</p>

    <h2>HTML is Packaging</h2>
    <p>Got something to share with others via the Internet? You'll need to package it. HTML is for packaging for
        the Web.<br />

        <ul>
            <li>Box is packaging for Amazon order&gt;</li>
            <li>Jar is packaging for jam</li>
            <li>Stamped envelope is packaging for letter</li>
            <li>Bottle is packaging for milk</li>
            <li>Wax Paper is packaging for meat</li>
        </ul>
    </aside>
    <p>Done well, packaging increases the chances of reaching your audience and growing your customer base. Done
        poorly, you can frustrate your audience, lose customers, and hurt your bottom line.</p>
    <p>Packaging protects products during delivery. It helps them gets to the customer unbroken. Some packaging
        creates value: communicating the brand, delighting customers, increasing loyalty, minimizing
        externalities, and helping your bottom line.</p>
    <h3>Functions of packaging</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe delivery.</strong> It makes sure all the parts included in the container, delivered
            unbroken, and made available as the customer needs them.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect processors.</strong> It makes sure that the product handlers can deliver the product
            quickly, accurately, and affordably without delays or mishaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevent tampering</strong> Helps customers trust that product is authentic and has not been
            adulterated. And protects creators from product liability damages.</li>
        <li><strong>Describe the product.</strong> Packaging must identify what is inside. Regulations may
            require creators to disclose ingredients, place of origin, risks, and more to promote consumer
            welfare.</li>
        <li><strong>Expedite delivery.</strong> shipping, distribution, and tracking. Addressing.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate brand.</strong> Apple's packaging is as iconic as their products. It supports a
            consistent experience across the product life cycle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Packaging can have broad social and environmental impacts. I can pollute our land, litter our streets,
        and and kill our seas. Or, it can be reused, composted, and feeds our gardens.<br />

        <h2>Eggs Packaging</h2>
        <p>Perhaps you designed packaging for eggs as a kid. An Egg Drop Project where you designed packaging to
            protect an egg from a three foot drop. But, to design packaging for a &gt; &gt; 7.93 billion egg
            industry is a different game.</p>

    <h2>HTML provides Meaning</h2>
    <p>Words can change the world. But, without structure (titles, paragraphs, sections, layout, pauses,
        emphasis) words are not very useful. Imagine the <cite>Declaration of Independence</cite>, <cite>Mother
            Goose</cite>, or a Sunday sermon spoken in even monotone, or one long line of text written on the
        highway between Los Angeles and Atlanta.</p>
    <p>We need structure to share our ideas with others.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Structure to provide meaning for people and to machines</li>
        <li>Presentation create impact and pleasant to receive</li>
        <li>Behavior to enable interaction</li>
        <li>Protection from forgery</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>An International Standard</h3>
    <p>HTML is a standard way for packaging content so it can be moved around and used by various agents on the
        Internet.</p>
    <p>HTML packaging helps<br /> * Google rank your pages and render them in search results.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Social media post your messages and embed your videos on your customer's streams.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Web browsers present a document to your customer as you intend it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Siri read your document out loud, with proper structure so your customer can follow your story.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Customer share your content with others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Your websites and applications have a consistent experience.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>HTML structures your content so is meaningful, allowing you to indicated titles, paragraphs, headings,
        lists, asides, sections, chapters, tables, and more.</p>
