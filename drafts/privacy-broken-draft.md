Reviewing privacy failures helps us understand how design can enhance privacy experience.

Privacy violation has been around for ever. It is involved in Blackmail, Stalking, Profiling, Industrial Espionage, Redlining, Blacklisting, Ostricization, Persecution, Discrimination, and Identity Theft are privacy-related harm.
    
* [16 million victims](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-identity-theft-and-cybercrime) of identity theft in 2017 in the United States.
* [16% of women and 6% of men](http://victimsofcrime.org/docs/default-source/ncvrw2015/2015ncvrw_stats_stalking.pdf?sfvrsn=2) have experienced stalking. A quarter of stalking victims report having been cyberstalked.

A brief catalog of crimes that depend on Privacy failure.

## Identity Theft

Alice received an offer from her health club, Acme Wellness. She visited acmewellness.coolstuff.club and submitted her name, email, mailing address, and account number and to request a free sample.

Phishing and other cyberscams are desiged to collect private information to aid identity theft. Criminals excel at copying writing styles and visual designs to create fake web, email, and print experiences.

Our design can help - and harm - our customers.<br /> Before adding tracking features, asking for more data, or using third-party code or services, consider the harm that design choices could cause.

Design choices:
    
* naming for domains and URL paths
* tools and hosting providers
* consistency
* development and authoring policies
* standards and quality
* technical framework
* brand policing
    
## Blackmail

Bob is threatened by a Mal who demands money or other services in exchange for not revealing potentially damaging private information obtained by getting Bob to share access to his microphone and media library.

## Stalking
Alice is stalked at home after her address was disclosed in proof of age check at the grocery store.

## Eavesdropping

Alice's vacation plans are stolen by Eve who sells the information to local cat burglers who clean out Alices house while she is away.

Third-party code libraries and web tools, like <cite>AddThis</cite>, may collect personal information to build targeted profiles for resale. Website owners are often unaware of the activity. If your putting a free social plugin on your site, it could be spying on your customers.

Profiles may enhance experience, but behavior advertising can appear at the wrong time and place. Do you want searches about &quot;transgenders&quot;, &quot;guns&quot; and &quot;animal torture&quot; in your work place. How about &quot;cancer&quot;? Or, your latest &quot;job&quot; searches?

## Espionage
Lost intellectual property. Lost business opportunities. A team steals your signs and playbook. A student access tomorrow's test. Lost personal relationship when your girl/boy friend learns they have a rival.

## Redlining

Excluded from offer set. Housing, education, food, healthcare, banking.

## Blacklisting

Access denied due to personal characteristics. In 20th century, workers were blacklisted from employment for their social networks (union membership). Screenwriters and actors were blacklisted in the 1950's for alleged political beliefs. Individuals have been denied medical treatment... credit cards (loans)


## Ostricization
No invitation to liberal events because researching conservative political views. No political cruise invitation because of geolocation. Individual is not aware of discrimination. Missed opportunities. But has been denied equal access to social benefits.

## Persecution

Woman convicted of blasphemy for drinking water while believing different. Individual assulted because attacker targetted religious affiliation.

## Discrimination

Names and education can reveal information about candidates gender, race, and age resulting in hiring discrimination and overlooked talent. 'Blind' applications can help promote equal opportunity.

## Unauthorized sharing of Personal Health Information

Teen purchase of pregnancy test at Target. Behavior shared with advertisers leading to increased baby advertising at home and parents discovery of child's sexual activity.
