    <p>WORKING DRAFT</p>
    <p>UX plays an important role in delivering privacy. (other dimensions: policy, reporting, training,
        technology, and experience.)</p>
    <p>Respect for individual privacy is essential for trust in social interactions. If you want to engage
        visitors in online transactions, then they will need to trust that you will not use their information
        against them. Online Privacy features should be designed in beginning of every web site.</p>
    <p>Online Privacy is protected by multiple State, Federal, and International Laws. Compliance should not
        interfere with core services, so keep design simple. First, design for strong Privacy protection and
        broad Compliance. Then, make exceptions as needed.</p>
